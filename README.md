# ALX Listing App.
---
## Project Description

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Design Tools**: Figma for UI/UX design

# Project Structure Overview

This project follows a modular and scalable folder structure to promote reusability and maintainability. Below is a breakdown of the key directories and their purposes:

## components/
This directory contains all reusable UI components used throughout the application.

## interfaces/
This folder holds all TypeScript interfaces and types used in the project to enforce type safety and improve code readability.

## constants/
This folder stores constant values that are reused across the application, helping to avoid magic strings and hardcoded values.

## public/assets/
This directory contains static files such as images, icons, and fonts. These assets can be referenced directly in the app using the `/assets/...` path.

---

This structure is designed to help you scale the application while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
